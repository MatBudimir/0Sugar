A wizard, lost in the world, searching for his way out of the forest. 

Image 1 - He comes upon a branching path - one leading to an uninhabited house, and the other a way further into the forest. 

Image 2 - If you choose to go into the house, you will have the choice of going up a ladder, or drinking a potion of DEATH.
Image 3 - At the top of the ladder you find a grimoire. Once it is found, you return to the branching path between the house and forest.

Image 4 - The only other option is the forest. Whether first choosing this or coming from the house, you can either gather berries or mushrooms. The mushrooms will, in fact, kill you. (After you trip balls. It'S an eventful, yet painful death.)
Image 5 - If you eat the berries, a new path forward will reveal itself.
