    <p>You are a young goblin boi, and it is a wonderfully dreary day in your moist cavern. 
    Somehow, rays of light manage to reach the dark depths in which you slumber, prompting you to <b>wake up</b>.
    However, you are tired from the previous night, one full of debauchery (), and you wish to <b>keep sleeping</b>.</p>
