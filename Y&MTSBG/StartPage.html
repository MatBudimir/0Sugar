    You are a young goblin boi, and it is a wonderfully dreary day in your moist cavern. 
    Somehow, rays of light manage to reach the dark depths in which you slumber, prompting you to **wake up**.
    However, you are tired from the previous night, one full of debauchery (), and you wish to *keep sleeping*.
